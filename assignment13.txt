ASSIGNMENT 13

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
  customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
  Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
->select cname, city, 'High Rating' as rating  from customers where rating>200
                           union
  select cname, city,  'Low Rating' as rating  from customers where rating <=200;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
  each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
  order.
->select cname, sname, salespeople.snum from salespeople, customers where 
  salespeople.snum=customers.snum and salespeople.snum in
  (select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1) order by sname,cname;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
  San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
  onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
  but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
  (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
  besides the point.)
-> select snum from salespeople where city='San Jose'
       union
   select cnum from customers where city='San Jose'
       union
   select onum from orders where odate='1990-10-03';
